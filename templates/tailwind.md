# Tailwind Application — Design Engineer

I'm Yury Egorenkov [yego.me](https://yego.me), a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, head of [purelab.io](https://purelab.io) and [aliens.dev](https://aliens.dev) team.

We work together with my partner Nelo Mitranim [mitranim.com](https://mitranim.com).

Code principles we're follow: [Guidelines](https://github.com/purelabio/guideline/blob/main/general.md)

## Our current project

We built from scratch is [Corespirit](https://corespirit.com)

Fully functional booking system and social network for online sessions, events, twitter inspired social network, articles, plenty of features.

In this project we're hired small team contractor. We did technical part only. Content and marketing is not our responsibility zone.

Core tech we're used: HTML/SASS/Javascript (frontend), Golang (backend), Postgresql (database). We have a really strong level in such technologies.

We also have Kubernetes, fully-automated CI/CD. Strict tests: we don't want to write or read any code without auto-tests, we write them a lot.

At first we used ReactJS for a several years. Now we're switch to [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements) because it's the future of SSR/SPA.

We're

  * weak at
    * pick colors
    * painting
    * art-design
  * strong at
    * coding
    * discovering great abstractions to easy express complex things
    * making something doesn't exist before and nowhere to pick

Our CSS is built from scratch and over the years, we developed ideas convergent with yours. At the time we were start the project we didn't know about existence of Tailwind. Also we were tired of Bootstrap-ish libraries they all easy to start using and really hard to opt-out and customize.

We believe in a pyramid of abstractions: lower level bricks forming higher level bricks. We think Tailwind needs one higher level layer and we're ready to share our ideas.

Speaking of CSS

  * Bottom: level is CSS
  * Medium: Atomic and Tailwind abstractions
  * Top and missing one: **How it looks — Not what it for**

We're pedantic about consistency and even have shirts with "consistency" written on them.

We really like your designs and want to build and improve them together!

Even if you don't hire us it would be very great to have conversation so we can share our ideas and maybe can push web-dev community to good (less code, easy dev, more fun). Or if you'd like we can do some projects for you not as part of your team as independent contractors.

Anyway it is a pleasure to be in touch with you, can't wait for response.

Best

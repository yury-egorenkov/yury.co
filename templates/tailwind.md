# Tailwind Application — Design Engineer

I'm Yury Egorenkov [yego.me](https://yego.me), a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, head of [purelab.io](https://purelab.io) and [aliens.dev](https://aliens.dev) team.

We work together with my partner Nelo Mitranim [mitranim.com](https://mitranim.com).

Code principles we're follow: [Guidelines](https://github.com/purelabio/guideline/blob/main/general.md)

## Our current project

We built from scratch is [Corespirit](https://corespirit.com)

Fully functional booking system and social network for online sessions, events, twitter inspired messaging, articles, plenty of features.

In this project we're hired small team contractor. We did technical part only. Content and marketing is not our responsibility zone.

Tech used: HTML/SASS/Javascript (frontend), Golang (backend), Postgresql (database)

And also Kubernetes, fully-automated CI/CD, strict tests. We don't want to read/write any code without tests.

At first we used ReactJS for a several years. Now we're switch to [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements) because it's the future of SSR/SPA.

We're strong at

  * coding
  * consistency
  * discovering great abstractions to easy express complex things
  * making something doesn't exist before and nowhere to pick

Our CSS is built from scratch and over the years, we developed ideas convergent with yours. At the time we were start the project we didn't know about existence of Tailwind. Also we were tired of Bootstrap-ish libraries they all easy to start using and really hard to opt-out and customize.

We believe in a pyramid of abstractions: lower level bricks forming higher level bricks. We think Tailwind needs higher level layer and we're ready to share our ideas.

  * Bottom: level is CSS
  * Medium: Atomic and Tailwind abstractions
  * Top and missing one: **How it looks — Not what it for**

We're pedantic about consistency and even have shirts with "consistency" written on them.

We're all about finding our own path, inventing new approaches, trying to improve on the status quo of technology, pushing the edge, and seeing where it gets us.

We really like your designs and we'd be happy to build and improve them together!

In any case it would be very great to have conversation so we can share our ideas and maybe can push web-dev community to good (less code, easy dev, more fun). Or if you'd like we can do some projects for you not as part of your team as independent contractors.

It is a pleasure to be in touch with you, can't wait for response.

Best

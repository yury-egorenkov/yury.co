# Overview

Yury Egorenkov — Professional Team Lead / Fullstack — [resume](https://resume.io/r/cCvDwckXS)

**Looking for an interesting project**

Professional full-stack developer and team lead of software developers group. Has been working on software for more than 15 years. Well, understand the process of building programs, both from the architectural or implementation point of view and from the point of view of management and organization of the workflow.

I prefer an iterative development process with a duration of one to two weeks. Each developer must send a valuable commit daily. We have an automatic system for the delivery and installation of new versions based on Drone, Docker, and Netlify. Customers and real users should get the real experience of using the product as soon as possible. Depending on their feedback and key parameters, it is possible to flexibly change the goals and priorities of the work.

In the past of several years, I was in the role of the head of Fullstack developers. I managed to select a team of high-performance developers and establish a stable workflow for creating software. As a result, many modern web services were built.
